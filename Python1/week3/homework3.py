# Question 1
# Create a program that tells you whether or not you need an umberella when you leave the house


# weather = input("is it raining outside?")
#
# if weather == 'y':
#     print('take umbrella')
# elif weather == 'n':
#     print("You do not need an umbrella")

# Question 2

# my_money = int(input('How much money do you have?'))  # error 1 - needed int as passing an int not str
# boat_cost = 20 + 5  # error 2 - incorrectly written, missing '_' syntax of variable
#
# if my_money >= boat_cost:  # error 3 - '<' is less than sign to correct sighn -  need to change to '>=+' because if my_money is more than or = to boat cost you can afford it else you can not
#     print("you can afford boat hire")
# else:
#     print("you cannot afford boat hire")
