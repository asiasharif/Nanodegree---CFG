<pre><span class="s0"># Question 1</span>

<span class="s0"># 1</span>

<span class="s0"># python is a powerful, high level, general purpose programming language. It is easy to learn and</span>

<span class="s0"># compact and easier understandable to write code.</span>

<span class="s0"># 2</span>

<span class="s0"># count() is a function that counts the number of time a string/int appears in a given list.</span>

<span class="s0"># example</span>

<span class="s1">my_list = [</span><span class="s2">&quot;a,b,c,d,e,f,a,b,d&quot;</span><span class="s1">]</span>

<span class="s1">print(my_list.count(</span><span class="s2">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="s1">))</span>

<span class="s0"># the above example will return the number of time 'a' appears in the list 'my_list' which is 2</span>


<span class="s0"># 3</span>

<span class="s0"># the function ord() takes a single character and returns its numerical values as defined in ASCII Table</span>

<span class="s0"># the chr() function basically does the opposite of ord(). It takes the numerical value and returns</span>

<span class="s0"># the chatacter equevalent of it as defined in the ascii table.</span>

<span class="s0"># example</span>

<span class="s1">x = chr(</span><span class="s3">72</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s1">print(x)</span>

<span class="s0"># will return the character 'H'</span>

<span class="s1">y = ord(</span><span class="s2">'p'</span><span class="s1">)</span>

<span class="s1">print(y)</span>

<span class="s0"># will return the integer '112'</span>


<span class="s0"># 4</span>

<span class="s1">the_string = </span><span class="s2">'2020-11-10_sales.csv'</span>

<span class="s1">new_string = the_string[</span><span class="s3">0</span><span class="s1">:-</span><span class="s3">4</span><span class="s1">]</span>

<span class="s1">print(new_string)</span>

<span class="s0"># 5</span>

<span class="s0"># A List in python can be added to or be subtracted from its values after it has been created and noted by</span>

<span class="s0"># square_bracket[] where as a tuple is immutable and is defined by parenthesis '()'</span>

<span class="s0"># the values in a tuple cannot be changed. cannot be added to or deleted from its values</span>

<span class="s0"># 6</span>

<span class="s0"># The difference between an append() and extend() function is that append() takes an argument and adds it to the end of</span>

<span class="s0"># a list which increases the length of the list by one, where as extend() takes any iterable list as a parameter and</span>

<span class="s0"># and adds to the list, which could increase the list by one or hundreds, depending on the length of the arguments passed.</span>


<span class="s0"># 7</span>

<span class="s0"># and infinite loop is one where it does not end. for instance:</span>

<span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
 
x = True 
 
while x: 
 
    do 
 
 
 
&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

<span class="s0"># the above code does not end as the value of x is always true unless its been edited within the while loop</span>

<span class="s0"># you can quit the program programmatically by giving it an exit() function within the while loop.</span>


<span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
 
x = True 
 
while x: 
 
    do 
 
    exit() 
 
 
 
&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

<span class="s0"># this will exit as soon as the loop reaches the exit() funtion. You can also quit the program by 'clt + C' on</span>

<span class="s0"># the keyboard.</span>


<span class="s0"># 8</span>


<span class="s0"># a functions parameter boils down to real value thats passed into a function as its argument.</span>


<span class="s0"># 9</span>

<span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
 
my_dic = {&quot;Apple&quot;:2,&quot;Juice&quot;:5&quot;} 
 
 
 
my_dic[&quot;Strawberry&quot;]=6 
 
 
 
&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
