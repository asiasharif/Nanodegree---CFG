### EXERCISE 1 ###

"""
Exercise 1.1: Now that you've run your first program, try the following:

- Change the message to anything you want
- Repeat the code on multiple lines to output several messages
- Find out what happens when you remove different parts of the code (e.g. brackets)
- Don't worry if something unexpected happens. Think about what you changed and why it might have caused it to happen.
"""
print("Hello World")
print("Asia")

### DEMO & EXERCISE 2 ###
"""
Use Python console in PyCharm and practice the Python operations together. 

What does each one do and what is its output?

Are there any outputs you didn't expect?

"""
print(1+1)
print(2 + 100)


### DEMO & EXERCISE 3 ###
"""
In your Python console run each of these
"""

# "Cat"
print("Cat" + " videos")
#
print("Cat" * 3)
#print("Cat" + 3) - threw an error
#
print("Cat".upper())
print("Cat".lower())
#
print("the lord of the rings".title())

Watch demo on variables
"""



### EXERCISE 7 ###
"""
In a new Python file called cat_food.py, create a program that calculates how many cans of cat food you need to feed 10 cats

Your will need:

A variable for the number of cats
A variable for the number of cans each cat eats in a day
A print() function to output the result
Extension: change the calculation to work out the amount needed for 7 days

"""



## EXERCISE 7 ###
"""
Rewrite cat_food.py to use string formatting instead of joining strings with +.

An example of string formatting:
--------------------------------

user_name = 'Jenny_1995'
age = 23

output = '{} is {} years old'.format(user_name, age)
print(output)

"""




### DEMO 8 ###
"""
Watch few examples on how to join strings together:
"""



### EXERCISE 8 ###
"""
Perform string formatting, so that your final sentence looks like this:
guests = ["Mary", "Pete", "Eoin"]

Result:
"We are going to cinema with my classmates: Mary, Pete, Eoin and me"

"""




### DEMO & EXERCISE 9 ###
"""
String Slicing examples

S = 'ABCDEFGHI'



Slice at Beginning & End

Omitting the start index starts the slice from the index. Meaning, S[:stop] is equivalent to S[0:stop]
Omitting the stop index extends the slice to the end of the string. Meaning, S[start:] is equivalent to S[start:len(S)]
